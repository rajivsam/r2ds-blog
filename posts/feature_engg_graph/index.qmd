## Feature Engineering using Graphs

Real estate is all about location. Graphs make it possible to do this with your learning problems. Imbalanced datasets are pervasive in real life: Modeling rare diseases and conditions, fraud detection, loan defaults, are all examples of datasets where the event of interest is rare. Using graphs to model such data make it possible to identify neighborhoods of these events and use them as features in your model. This is a simple idea, but it works. Check out an implementation of this idea to predict the performance of loans gauranteed by the SBA. The SBA 7a loan performance data is publicly available. The implementation and results are available in the [descriptive analytics repository](https://github.com/rajivsam/descriptive_analytics/blob/main/examples/sba_7a_loans_analysis/sba_7a_loans_desc_analysis.pdf)
