This post is more of a rant, really. I’m fine with asking ChatGPT for movie recommendations on Netflix or Prime, but when it comes to answering complex, nuanced questions that demand rigor and careful validation of assumptions, I draw the line. Yet, it seems impossible to escape the ubiquitous question: "But what does ChatGPT say?"

Foundational models for everything? Really? Let’s break this down at a basic level. Assuming I’m even solving the right problem for my use case—which is far from trivial—here’s what I aim to do when tackling a problem:

1. **Identify sources of variation**: For tasks like regression, I want to pinpoint every factor that contributes to variation in the data.
2. **Validate these sources**: This requires rigor and due diligence to ensure they are legitimate contributors.
3. **Account for unexplained variance**: Ideally, this should be minimal. If it’s significant, I need to investigate further and determine how to address it. Even then, I want to ensure the model remains useful—better than having no model or sticking with the status quo.

I’m skeptical of the notion that all problems can be reduced to the same sources of variation or that there’s a universal method to identify them. If such a method exists, it must be demonstrated rigorously—not through cherry-picked examples.

Sure, I understand that certain approaches work well within specific problem domains. However, what I often encounter is this: "This approach worked for situation A, so let’s try it for situation B," without any solid justification that A and B are meaningfully similar.
