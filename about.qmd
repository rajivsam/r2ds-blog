Welcome to my blog, where I explore a variety of topics that pique my interest, including:

1. Analyzing, summarizing, and optimizing large datasets for business machine learning tasks.
2. Developing discrete and continuous optimization models for business applications.
3. Leveraging graph data models and algorithms to address business challenges.
4. Applying statistical modeling techniques to solve business problems.
